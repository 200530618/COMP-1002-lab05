            <p>I was born and raised in India. I spent my most of the time in my hometown. I learned many things and skills there. My hometown is Panipat, which is a small town in Haryana provence. But Panipat is called the city of weavers, as it produces textiles and carpets. It is the biggest center for quality blankets and carpets in India and has a hand loom weaving industry. Panipat city is the biggest centre of “shoddy yarn” in the World. I am proud of my city.</p>

        <h3>Future Goals</h3>
        <p>
            I want to be a software developer. Then I want to open a startup and run my business here in my own way or in a new way. Because Over the past decades, Canada has diligently cultivated a burgeoning startup culture with government-backed funding, incubators, tax incentives, and even special startup visas. Canada is considered the Silicon Valley of the north, and with its booming cities and excellent universities its efforts are paying off.
